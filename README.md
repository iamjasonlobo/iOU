Description: "iOU" is a webapp that allows college students to reshape their campus economy. It introduces a unique currency called "OU," derived from valuable services. Users can provide their skills and services, like tutoring or tech support, in exchange for OU credits.

On the flip side, students can request services they need, paying with their OU credits. This system not only controls the college economy but also economically empowers students, fostering a strong sense of community and cooperation. The app simplifies transactions with an easy-to-use interface, enforces fairness through a point system, and ensures data security. It's a revolution in college life, promoting self-sufficiency and community building.
